Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari

I used React and Create React App, I wanted to use React and Create React App makes it easy to start.

All my source files are under src folder with some comments on what they do.

I focused on structure and functionality but didn't finish :(

To test the app, first do `npm install` and then `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000/

I didn't have time to do any CSS, so styling is ugly.

I wanted to use Prime React components for proper styling and better functionality.

I added some basic error checks, but not edge cases.
